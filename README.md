# Portal Reef Team
Portal Reef is a multimodal sensory project with an interactive immersive environment shown through Hololens 2 and Neuos and EEG-based interface SDK to raise awareness of coral reef destruction or coral bleaching. We're using visual, auditory, and hand tracking to create an interactive environment for users to experience how human touches trigger coral reef destruction. The audience will be running into fish, seashells, and endangered coral species in the scenery. When they approach the endangered corals, the informative bubble will be available for people to learn about the characteristics of each endangered coral.
